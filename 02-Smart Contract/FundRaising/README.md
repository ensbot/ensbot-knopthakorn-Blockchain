# Fundraising contract

## Planing and Design

1. Contritbutors <span style="color:red"> will send money to a smart contract</span> instead of to a person's bank account.

2. In a traditional application <span style="color:red"> the campaign administrator has a full control of donated funds</span>, there is no outside control.

3. In our contract <span style="color:red">the admin must create a spending request</span> that <span style="color: red">must be voted by the contributors</span> before that amount is released and sent to the recipient - the vendor, supplier.

4. **The power is moved from the campaign admin to those that donated money.**

5. The fundraising campaign will have a **deadline** and a **goal** and if any of these two conditions are not met **the contributor will get a refund**
