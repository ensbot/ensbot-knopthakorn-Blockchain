# How are Tokens Used on the Blockchain?

## What are Tokens?
- Privately issued coin-like items that have insignificant value
- Examples: transportation tokens, laundry tokens, arcade tokens etc.
- Insignificant value because of limited use of physical tokens
- Restricted to specific businesses/organization/locations
- Not easily exchangeable
- Can’t be used for more than one function

## Tokens on the Blockchain
- Blockchain-based abstractions that can be owned and that
represent assets, currency or access rights
- Restrictions of physical tokens erased
    - Serve multiple purposes globally
    - Can be traded for each other / other currencies in
global liquid markets

## How are Tokens Used?
- **Currency** (ETH / BTC)
- **Resource** (storage / CPU token
representing resources that can
be shared over a network)
- **Asset** (gold, real estate, a car,
oil, energy)
- **Attestation** (marriage record,
birth certificate, college degree)
- **Access** (discussion forum,
exclusive website, hotel room,
rental car)
- **Equity** (DAO / corporation)
- **Voting** (digital / legal)
- **Collectible** (Cryptokitties, a
painting)
- **Identity** (avatar, national ID)

## Tokens and Fungibility
- **Fungibile** ⇒ we can substitute any single unit of the
token for another without any difference in its value or
function (i.e. ETH)
- **Non-fungible** ⇒ each unit represents a unique item and
isn’t interchangeable (i.e. Van Gogh vs. Picasso painting
/ Cryptokitties)

## Counterparty Risk
- The risk that the <span style="color: #48dbfb">other party</span> in a transaction will fail to meet their obligation
- Often because of the addition of more than two parties
    - Someone holds the <span style="color: #48dbfb">physical asset</span> and by necessity they become a party
and adds counterparty risk to any transaction involving that asset
- Important to understand who holds the asset that is represented by the token
and what rules apply to that underlying asset

## Tokens and Intrinsicality
- Some tokens represent digital items that are <span style="color: #48dbfb">intrinsic</span> to the blockchain
    - Governed by consensus rules just like the tokens themselves
- Many tokens are used to represent <span style="color: #48dbfb">extrinsic</span> things like real-estate, corporate
voting shares, trademarks, gold bars
    - Governed by policy that is separate from the consensus rules that govern
the token
- Replace extrinsic assets into intrinsic assets and remove counterparty risk

## Using Tokens: Utility or Equity
- Tokens used in one of two ways:
    - **<span style="color: #48dbfb">Utility</span>** ⇒ the user of the token is required to pay for a service, application or
resource (i.e. ETH as gas for ETH platform)
    - **<span style="color: #48dbfb">Equity</span>** ⇒ represent shares in a startup (non-voting shares for distribution of
dividends or voting shares in a DAO)
- The two roles are conflated / difficult to distinguish
    - Tokens are a great fund-raising mechanism, but offering equity to the public is a
regulated activity
    - Many startups disguise equity tokens as utility tokens to get around regulatory
restrictions

## Token Standards
- The _<span style="color: #48dbfb">minimum</span>_ specification for an implementation of a token
- Encourages interoperability between contracts
- All wallets, exchanges, user interfaces can interface with a
predictable way with any token contract that follows the standard
- Examples of implementations and specifications on github (i.e.
ERC20, ERC721 etc.)


## Tokens and ICOs
- Tokens are a very foundational component of all smart-contract
platforms like ETH
- Must separate the long-term vision of the technology from the
short-term bubble of token ICOs, which is rife with fraud
- The token standards and platform will survive the token maina
and then will likely change the world
